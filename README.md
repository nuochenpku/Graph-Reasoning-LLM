<div style="text-align: center;"><strong>This  project aims at leveraging instruction-tuning to build a powerful instruction-following LLM that can map textural descriptions of graphs and structures, and then solve different graph problems explicitly in natural language.</strong></div>
To accomplish this, we make the following works:

- **GraphWiz**, a series of instruction-following LLMs that have strong  graph problem-solving abilities and output explicit reasoning paths.
- **GraphInstruct**, which offers over 72.5k training samples across nine graph problem
tasks, ranging in complexity from linear and polynomial to NP-complete, extending the scope, scale,
and diversity of previous benchmarks.

### Quick Start



```
# Use a pipeline as a high-level helper
from transformers import pipeline

pipe = pipeline("text-generation", model="GraphWiz/Mistral-7B")
alpaca_template = "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request. \n### Instruction:\n{query}\n\n### Response:"

query = "Find the shortest path between two nodes in an undirected graph. In an undirected graph, (i,j,k) means that node i and node j are connected with an undirected edge with weight k. Given a graph and a pair of nodes, you need to output the shortest path between the two nodes. Q: The nodes are numbered from 0 to 8, and the edges are: (0,1,4) (1,2,7) (1,7,1) (1,3,4) (2,6,2) (2,4,8) (2,7,5) (3,6,1) (4,8,3) (5,6,6) (6,8,8) (7,8,7). Give the weight of the shortest path from node 0 to node 8."


input = alpaca_template.format(query = query)

output = pipeline(input)[0]['generated_text']
print(output)
```
## Training GraphWiz 


Our training strategies include two stage: **Mixed-task Training** and **DPO Alignment**.

### Inference & Test

```
cd evaluation
bash test_graph.sh
```


## GraphInstruct Construction


<br>
<div align="center">
  <img src="figures/graph_collection.png" width="90%" title="Introduction Figure">
</div>


If you want to construct additional graph problem data for training your own models for graph problem reasoning. Please refer to the following:

### Generate Graph Problems

#### step1: Generate all train set

```
cd scripts
bash generate_all_train_datasets.sh
```

#### Generate all test set

```
cd scripts
bash generate_all_test_datasets.sh
```

### Step2: Data Augmentation with Rejection Sampling
Here, we introduce how to select diverse paths for dpo training data:

#### Step2.1: Inference SFT model multiple times
 Suppose we already have the sft model. You can directly use our models at HuggingFace: [**GraphWiz**](https://huggingface.co/GraphWiz)
```
cd evaluation
bash rft.sh
```
The default inference times 'seed' is set to 20.

#### Step2.2: Select the diverse paths 

Then we filter out the diverse reasoning paths:

```
cd find_paths
python3 select_path_dpo.py

python3 find_path.py
```

Please note that you should changle the data paths according to your local enviroment.

At last, you can obtain the json file like:

```
 "0": {
        "neg_response": [
            "To find the maximum flow from node 4 to node 8, we need to consider all the possible paths from node 4 to node 7, and then from node 7 to node 8. \nOne such path is 4->5->7->8, which can carry a flow of 6 units, as limited by the edge (4->5).\nAnother path is 4->6->7->8, which can carry a flow of 7 units, as limited by the edge (4->6).\nHowever, not all of this flow can reach node 8, because the edge (7->8) has a capacity of 3 units, and the edge (6->8) has a capacity of 10 units. Therefore, the bottleneck of this path is the edge (7->8), which reduces the flow to 3 units.\nTherefore, by adding the flows of the two paths, we get the maximum flow from node 4 to node 8 as 6 + 7 = 13 units.\n### The maximum flow from node 4 to node 8 is 13 units.",
            "The maximum flow from node 4 to node 8 is equal to the sum of the flows on the edges leaving node 4, which is 7 + 6 = 13 units. ### 13.",
            "To find the maximum flow from node 4 to node 8, we need to consider all possible paths from node 4 to node 8 and their capacities. One such path is 4->5->7->8, which has a capacity of 6 units, as limited by the edge (4->5). Another path is 4->6->8, which has a capacity of 7 units, as limited by the edge (4->6). However, note that the edge (6->8) has a smaller capacity of 10 units, so it cannot carry all the flow from node 4 to node 8 via this path. Therefore, we need to hybridize the two paths and find a way to allocate the flow between them without compromising the edge capacities. One possible allocation is to send 6 units from node 4 to node 5, 3 units from node 5 to node 7, and 7 units from node 4 to node 6, which gives a total flow of 6 + 3 + 7 = 16 units. However, this allocation is not optimal, as it wastefully converts 6 units of flow from node 4 to node 5, which is then unnecessarily routed to node 7. A more optimal allocation is to send 3 units from node 4 to node 5, 6 units from node 5 to node 7, and 7 units from node 4 to node 6, which gives a total flow of 3 + 6 + 7 = 16 units. This allocation avoids the conversion of any flow from node 4 to node 5, which is then routed to node 7. Hence, the maximum flow from node 4 to node 8 is 16 units, which is the sum of the flows along the two paths.### 16.",
