Determine if a smaller graph is present as an exact match within a larger graph. 
In a directed graph, (i->j) means that node i and node j are connected with a directed edge from node i to node j. 
Given a graph G and a subgraph G', you need to output Yes or No, indicating whether subgraph G' is present within the directed graph G.

Below are examples:


Q: The nodes of graph G are numbered from 0 to 7, and the edges are: (0->4) (0->5) (0->2) (0->3) (0->1) (0->7) (1->6) (1->5) (1->4) (1->7) (1->3) (2->7) (2->5) (2->6) (2->3) (3->4) (3->6) (3->7) (3->5) (4->7) (4->6) (4->5) (5->6) (5->7) (6->7). The nodes of subgraph G' are numbered from a to e, and the edges are: (a->b) (b->c) (b->e) (b->d) (c->e) (c->d). Is subgraph G' present within graph G as a direct substructure?
A: To determine if subgraph G' is present within graph G, let's briefly analyze both graphs:
Subgraph G' has the following edges: (a->b), (b->c), (b->e), (b->d), (c->e), (c->d). The key node here is 'b', which has outgoing edges to three different nodes: 'c', 'e', and 'd'. Additionally, 'c' has outgoing edges to both 'e' and 'd'.
Now let's find a node in graph G with similar outgoing edges:
Node 0 has outgoing edges to many nodes but is not a match since no single node has outgoing edges to three other nodes that also interconnect as required.
Node 1 has outgoing edges to '6', '5', '4', and '7' but none of these nodes have the required interconnections to match 'c', 'e', and 'd'.
Node 2 has outgoing edges to '7', '5', '6', and '3', but again, no suitable interconnections.
Node 3 has outgoing edges to '4', '6', '7', and '5'. This resembles 'b' in G', but there must be interconnections between the nodes it points to, matching (c->e), (c->d).
Node 4 has outgoing edges to '7', '6', and '5'. If node 4 is 'b', then nodes '7', '6', and '5' could be 'c', 'e', and 'd'. Since '7', '6', and '5' are all interconnected, node 4 and its connected nodes match the structure of G'.
Thus, the sequence (4->7), (7->6), (7->5), (6->7), (5->7) in G corresponds to the sequence (b->c), (c->e), (c->d), (e->d), (d->e) in G', which means subgraph G' is present as a direct substructure in graph G. ### Yes.


Q: The nodes of graph G are numbered from 0 to 9, and the edges are: (0->6) (0->2) (1->2) (1->7) (1->3) (3->4) (3->8) (3->9) (4->9). The nodes of subgraph G' are numbered from a to d, and the edges are: (a->d) (a->c) (a->b) (b->d) (b->c) (c->d). Is subgraph G' present within graph G as a direct substructure?
A:To find if subgraph G' is present in graph G, we look for a node with out-degree of 3 (like 'a' in G'), and among those outgoing connections, we need two nodes with an out-degree of at least 2 (like 'b' and 'c' in G'), which are also connected to each other and to the third node (like 'd' in G').
Examining graph G:
Node 0 has out-degree 2, not enough to match 'a'.
Node 1 has out-degree 3, so it could be 'a', with nodes 2, 7, and 3 potentially being 'b', 'c', and 'd'.
Node 3 has out-degree 3, so it could be 'a', with nodes 4, 8, and 9 potentially being 'b', 'c', and 'd'.
Now we must check the connections between the potential 'b', 'c', and 'd' nodes:
For node 1 as 'a', nodes 2, 7, and 3 do not have the required mutual connections.
For node 3 as 'a', nodes 4, 8, and 9 do not have the required mutual connections either, since there's no edge from 4 to 8 or 9 to 8.
None of the nodes satisfy the conditions of subgraph G' fully. ### No.
