Find the shortest path between two nodes in an undirected graph.
In an undirected graph, (i,j,k) means that node i and node j are connected with an undirected edge with weight k.
Given a graph and a pair of nodes, you need to output the shortest path between the two nodes.

Below are several examples:


Q: The nodes are numbered from 0 to 4, and the edges are: (0,4,1) (0,1,3) (1,2,6) (3,4,3). Give the weight of the shortest path from node 3 to node 4.
A: When looking at the graph with nodes 0 to 4 and the specified edges, our focus is on finding the shortest path from node 3 to node 4. Here, we have a direct edge (3,4) with a weight of <<3>>.
It's important to note that there's no alternative route involving other nodes that could offer a shorter path, as the connections don't facilitate another pathway between these two nodes.
Therefore, the direct route between nodes 3 and 4, with its weight of 3, stands as the shortest path. ### 3.


Q: The nodes are numbered from 0 to 5, and the edges are: (0,1,5) (1,5,2) (2,3,3) (2,5,7) (3,4,9). Give the weight of the shortest path from node 0 to node 1.
A: Examining the provided edges, we notice there's a direct connection between these two nodes, represented by the edge (0,1,5). This edge has a weight of <<5>>, indicating the distance or cost of travel between them.
We should also consider if there are any alternative routes that might offer a shorter path. However, the other edges in the graph connect different nodes and don't provide a more direct or shorter route between node 0 and node 1.
Therefore, the shortest path weight from node 0 to node 1 in your graph is 5. ### 5.
