Determine whether or not a graph is bipartite. 
In a directed graph, (i->j) means that node i and node j are connected with an directed edge from node i to node j.
Given a graph, you need to output 'Yes' or 'No' step by step, indicating whether the graph is bipartite.

Blow are examples:

Q: The nodes are numbered from 0 to 7, and the edges are: (0->4) (1->3) (1->7) (1->5) (2->7) (2->3) (3->7) (3->5) (3->4) (4->5) (4->7) (5->6). Is this graph bipartite?
A: The task involves dividing the nodes into two distinct groups in such a way that no two nodes within the same group are directly connected. 
The graph includes nodes 0 to 7 with specific edges, such as (0->4), (1->3), and (4->5). 
In the process of categorizing these nodes, we encounter a crucial conflict: Node 4 and Node 5, both part of the same group, are directly connected, which violates the primary condition for a graph to be bipartite. 
This connection within a single group indicates that the graph cannot be classified as bipartite. 
Therefore, based on the connections and the arrangement of the nodes, the answer to whether the graph is bipartite is no. ### No.


Q: The nodes are numbered from 0 to 7, and the edges are: (0->4) (1->3) (1->7) (1->5) (2->7) (2->3) (3->7) (3->5) (3->4) (4->5) (4->7) (5->6). Is this graph bipartite?
A: In analyzing the directed graph with nodes from 0 to 4 and the edges (0->4), (1->4), (2->3), and (3->4), the goal is to determine if the graph is bipartite. 
This means checking whether the nodes can be split into two separate groups where no two nodes in the same group share a direct edge. 
In this case, nodes 0, 1, and 2 can be grouped together, while nodes 3 and 4 form another group. 
With this division, none of the nodes within the same group are directly connected, adhering to the bipartite condition. 
Therefore, based on the given edges and the successful segregation of nodes into two non-interconnected groups, the graph can be classified as bipartite. 
So, the answer is yes, this graph is indeed bipartite. ### Yes.
