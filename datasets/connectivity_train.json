The nodes are numbered from 0 to 89, and the edges are: (0, 56) (0, 36) (0, 37) (1, 9) (2, 38) (2, 42) (2, 33) (2, 56) (3, 77) (3, 72) (3, 18) (4, 86) (4, 85) (4, 40) (4, 17) (5, 8) (5, 77) (6, 31) (7, 63) (8, 47) (8, 89) (8, 55) (9, 28) (9, 55) (9, 88) (9, 70) (9, 65) (10, 85) (10, 55) (11, 63) (11, 82) (12, 66) (12, 64) (12, 88) (13, 76) (13, 31) (15, 44) (16, 53) (16, 19) (16, 18) (19, 49) (21, 78) (22, 68) (23, 31) (24, 65) (24, 28) (24, 38) (24, 79) (25, 60) (25, 73) (26, 51) (27, 71) (27, 67) (27, 81) (27, 43) (27, 58) (27, 40) (27, 76) (28, 66) (28, 63) (29, 89) (29, 69) (29, 32) (30, 80) (32, 73) (32, 56) (32, 74) (34, 51) (34, 65) (34, 64) (34, 42) (35, 82) (35, 57) (35, 46) (36, 61) (36, 53) (38, 69) (38, 88) (38, 82) (38, 77) (40, 73) (40, 76) (40, 43) (42, 84) (43, 75) (44, 77) (45, 73) (45, 72) (47, 68) (49, 58) (52, 86) (53, 80) (54, 67) (54, 70) (54, 73) (55, 59) (56, 89) (57, 76) (59, 88) (59, 76) (61, 72) (65, 85) (65, 73) (67, 83) (68, 83) (81, 86) (87, 89). Q: Is there a path between node 56 and node 35? Output Yes or No. Let's think step by step. A: ", "answer": "### Yes"}
