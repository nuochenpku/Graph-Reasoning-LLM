Q: The nodes are numbered from 0 to 20, and the edges are: (0->5) (0->11) (0->1) (0->7) (0->6) (0->14) (0->17) (0->4) (0->13) (0->12) (0->18) (0->20) (0->2) (0->10) (0->9) (0->19) (0->16) (0->3) (1->6) (1->3) (1->5) (1->12) (1->20) (1->19) (1->2) (1->16) (1->8) (1->7) (1->17) (1->13) (1->14) (1->18) (1->4) (1->10) (1->9) (1->11) (1->15) (2->11) (2->4) (2->10) (2->8) (2->14) (2->7) (2->12) (2->17) (2->3) (2->9) (2->6) (2->15) (2->13) (2->19) (2->18) (2->20) (2->5) (3->9) (3->5) (3->16) (3->15) (3->20) (3->13) (3->10) (3->18) (3->4) (3->11) (3->17) (3->7) (3->19) (3->12) (3->14) (4->12) (4->14) (4->6) (4->7) (4->10) (4->16) (4->20) (4->19) (4->8) (4->9) (4->5) (4->17) (4->13) (4->15) (5->10) (5->6) (5->16) (5->20) (5->18) (5->9) (5->8) (5->7) (5->12) (5->11) (5->13) (5->17) (5->19) (5->15) (6->16) (6->19) (6->11) (6->18) (6->8) (6->15) (6->14) (6->13) (6->12) (6->9) (6->10) (7->10) (7->16) (7->15) (7->8) (7->12) (7->11) (7->13) (7->19) (7->14) (7->20) (7->17) (8->16) (8->11) (8->15) (8->18) (8->10) (8->17) (8->13) (8->9) (9->14) (9->10) (9->12) (9->13) (9->18) (9->11) (9->17) (9->16) (9->19) (9->20) (10->11) (10->19) (10->15) (10->12) (10->16) (10->13) (10->17) (10->20) (10->18) (11->20) (11->13) (11->14) (11->15) (11->17) (11->12) (12->20) (12->18) (12->17) (12->14) (12->19) (12->16) (13->16) (13->14) (13->20) (13->15) (13->18) (13->17) (13->19) (14->16) (14->18) (14->17) (14->19) (14->15) (14->20) (15->17) (15->20) (15->19) (15->16) (16->20) (16->18) (16->19) (16->17) (17->18) (17->20) (17->19) (18->20) (18->19) (19->20).
