In a directed graph, (i->j) means that node i and node j are connected with a directed edge from node i to node j. Given a graph G and a subgraph G', you need to output Yes or No, indicating whether subgraph G' is present within the directed graph G. Q: The nodes of graph G are numbered from 0 to 34, and the edges are: (0->10) (0->15) (0->34) (0->7) (0->24) (0->21) (0->14) (0->31) (0->5) (0->32) (1->30) (1->19) (1->21) (1->28) (1->11) (1->15) (1->20) (1->25) (1->16) (1->10) (1->17) (1->26) (1->12) (2->16) (2->26) (2->12) (2->22) (2->25) (2->15) (2->5) (2->7) (2->34) (2->4) (2->17) (2->29) (2->28) (2->14) (2->3) (2->32) (3->30) (3->34) (3->28) (3->23) (3->4) (3->5) (3->27) (3->21) (3->17) (3->9) (3->6) (3->16) (3->13) (3->18) (4->8) (4->33) (4->24) (4->25) (4->12) (4->17) (4->6) (5->9) (5->20) (5->8) (5->32) (5->6) (5->12) (5->22) (5->30) (5->21) (5->28) (6->34) (6->13) (6->24) (6->29) (6->15) (6->17) (6->12) (6->30) (6->26) (6->19) (6->18) (6->10) (6->31) (7->23) (7->13) (7->33) (7->15) (7->32) (7->19) (7->20) (7->30) (7->26) (7->14) (7->10) (7->25) (8->9) (8->12) (8->26) (8->11) (8->19) (8->30) (8->23) (8->14) (8->20) (8->25) (9->12) (9->26) (9->33) (9->20) (9->13) (9->21) (9->15) (9->32) (9->31) (10->17) (10->29) (10->32) (10->27) (10->19) (10->11) (10->20) (10->33) (10->13) (10->30) (10->14) (10->34) (10->22) (10->28) (11->26) (11->16) (11->27) (11->28) (11->17) (11->14) (11->20) (11->12) (11->31) (11->21) (12->20) (12->13) (12->27) (12->24) (12->31) (12->17) (12->21) (12->34) (13->28) (13->14) (13->17) (13->15) (13->19) (13->29) (13->32) (13->18) (13->27) (14->27) (14->24) (14->21) (14->25) (14->34) (14->15) (14->31) (14->29) (14->28) (14->18) (15->18) (15->29) (15->27) (15->22) (15->31) (15->32) (15->21) (16->20) (16->26) (16->29) (16->25) (16->23) (16->18) (16->31) (17->22) (17->20) (17->26) (17->28) (17->23) (17->31) (17->34) (17->21) (17->32) (17->25) (18->34) (18->23) (18->26) (18->19) (19->24) (19->32) (19->21) (19->29) (19->28) (19->30) (20->28) (20->25) (20->33) (20->27) (20->26) (20->23) (20->30) (21->22) (21->23) (21->34) (21->27) (21->26) (22->34) (22->25) (22->26) (22->31) (23->25) (23->31) (23->34) (23->26) (23->24) (23->28) (24->34) (24->28) (24->31) (24->32) (24->27) (24->26) (25->27) (25->32) (25->30) (26->28) (26->30) (26->33) (27->33) (27->32) (27->28) (28->34) (28->33) (28->29) (29->32) (29->33) (29->34) (29->30) (31->33) (31->32). The nodes of subgraph G' are numbered from a to p, and the edges are: (a->m) (a->o) (a->b) (b->f) (b->g) (c->e) (c->n) (c->j) (d->o) (e->o) (e->j) (f->l) (f->k) (h->j) (h->p) (h->l) (h->m) (i->k) (i->o) (j->o) (k->p) (k->n) (k->o) (l->n) (l->m) (n->o). Is subgraph G' present within graph G as a direct substructure?", "answer": "### Yes", "node_range": [30, 35], "edge_range": [43, 357]}
