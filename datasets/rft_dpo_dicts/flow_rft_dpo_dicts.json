            "In this case, the graph has 18 nodes and 80 edges, so the number of edges is much greater than the number of nodes. Therefore, the graph must have a cycle, and it does: the cycle of length 8 formed by nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12. This cycle contains five edges that are redundant for the flow, because they create loops within the cycle instead of extending the flow to the outside nodes. Hence, by exploiting the cycle structure, we can eliminate five edges from the flow and reduce the graph to 17 nodes and 75 edges. This is still much greater than the number of nodes, but it is enough to guarantee that the graph has no more cycles and therefore can be divided into two disjoint sets. Hence, the graph can be split into two groups, and the flow can be assigned to one group while the other group is assigned to the flow. This is indeed the case, and we can see that the flow is assigned to group A, while group B is assigned to the flow. Therefore, the graph and the flow satisfy the condition for being bipartite, and we can conclude that the graph is bipartite and the flow is bipartite. ### Yes.",

To see this, we can consider the possible paths and their capacities, and then subtract the minimum capacity from the maximum capacity to obtain the flow. For example, one path is from node 15 to node 38 and then from node 38 to node 70, with a capacity of 2 units on the first edge and 8 units on the second edge. Another path is from node 15 to node 30 and then from node 30 to node 70, with a capacity of 10 units on the first edge and no units on the second edge, since the edge does not exist in the original graph. Therefore, the flow along this path is 0 units. We can repeat this process for all the paths and find that the path with the highest flow is the first one, and the flow along it is 13 units. ### 13."
