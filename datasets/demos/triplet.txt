Find the maximum sum of the weights of three interconnected nodes. 
In an undirected graph, [i, k] means that node i has the weight k. (i,j) means that node i and node j are connected with an undirected edge. 
Given a graph, you need to output the maximum sum of the weights of three interconnected nodes. 

Below are several examples:

Q: The nodes are numbered from 0 to 4, weights of nodes are: [0, 2] [1, 9] [2, 6] [3, 10] [4, 4], and the edges are: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 3) (2, 4) (3, 4). What is the maximum sum of the weights of three interconnected nodes?
A: The nodes and their weights are as follows: Node 0 with weight 2, Node 1 with weight 9, Node 2 with weight 6, Node 3 with weight 10, and Node 4 with weight 4. 
Upon examining the connections between these nodes, it becomes evident that only Nodes 0, 1, and 3 form a fully interconnected set, with each node directly connected to the other two. The sum of their weights is <<2 (Node 0) + 9 (Node 1) + 10 (Node 3) = 21>>.
Therefore, the maximum sum of the weights of three interconnected nodes in this graph is 21. ### 21.


Q: The nodes are numbered from 0 to 4, weights of nodes are: [0, 9] [1, 3] [2, 5] [3, 9] [4, 4], and the edges are: (0, 4) (0, 1) (1, 4) (2, 3). What is the maximum sum of the weights of three interconnected nodes?
A: The graph comprises nodes 0 to 4, each with respective weights of 9, 3, 5, 9, and 4. 
Analyzing the graph's edges reveals that Nodes 0, 1, and 4 are the only trio of connected nodes, linked through the edges (0, 4), (0, 1), and (1, 4). 
By adding their weights:  <<9 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) +  4 (Node 4) = 16>>. There are no other groups of three interconnected nodes in this graph. 
Therefore, the maximum sum of the weights of three connected nodes in this graph is determined to be 16. ### 16.


Q: The nodes are numbered from 0 to 4, weights of nodes are: [0, 6] [1, 9] [2, 10] [3, 3] [4, 6], and the edges are: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 4) (3, 4). What is the maximum sum of the weights of three interconnected nodes?
A: The nodes and their weights are as follows: Node 0 weighs 6, Node 1 weighs 9, Node 2 weighs 10, Node 3 weighs 3, and Node 4 weighs 6. 
Analyzing the connections, we find that Nodes 1, 2, and 4 are interconnected, each directly connected to the other two. The sum of their weights is <<9 (Node 1) + 10 (Node 2) + 6 (Node 4) = 25>>.
Therefore, in this graph, the maximum sum of the weights of three interconnected nodes (1, 2, and 4) is 25. ### 25.


Q: The nodes are numbered from 0 to 6, weights of nodes are: [0, 8] [1, 8] [2, 1] [3, 7] [4, 1] [5, 4] [6, 7], and the edges are: (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 5) (5, 6). What is the maximum sum of the weights of three interconnected nodes?
A: The graph comprises nodes with the following weights: Node 0 at 8, Node 1 also at 8, Node 2 at 1, Node 3 at 7, Node 4 at 1, Node 5 at 4, and Node 6 at 7.
Upon scrutinizing the connections between these nodes, we find several groups of three interconnected nodes, including Nodes 3, 4, and 5; Nodes 0, 4, and 2; Nodes 0, 2, and 6; and Nodes 4, 5, and 6. 
Let's calculate the sum of weights for these groups:
Nodes 3, 4, and 5: <<7 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 4 (Node 5) = 12>>.
Nodes 0, 4, and 2: <<8 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 2) = 10>>.
Nodes 0, 2, and 6: <<8 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 7 (Node 6) = 16>>.
Nodes 4, 5, and 6: <<1 (Node 4) + 4 (Node 5) + 7 (Node 6) = 12>>.
Calculating the total weights for these groups, the combination of Nodes 0, 2, and 6 emerges as the one with the highest total weight, amounting to 16 (8 from Node 0, 1 from Node 2, and 7 from Node 6).
Therefore, in this graph, the maximum sum of the weights of three interconnected nodes is 16. ### 16.
