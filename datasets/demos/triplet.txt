Q: The nodes are numbered from 0 to 15, weights of nodes are: [0, 3] [1, 8] [2, 6] [3, 1] [4, 7] [5, 3] [6, 3] [7, 4] [8, 4] [9, 1] [10, 4] [11, 8] [12, 8] [13, 3] [14, 5] [15, 1], and the edges are: (0, 11) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 8) (1, 12) (1, 9) (1, 15) (1, 13) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 11) (2, 11) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 8) (3, 9) (3, 13) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 15) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 12) (6, 9) (6, 15) (6, 11) (6, 8) (7, 14) (7, 11) (8, 10) (8, 14) (8, 9) (9, 11) (9, 10) (10, 12) (10, 11) (10, 13) (11, 12) (13, 15) (14, 15). What is the maximum sum of the weights of three nodes?
A: To find the maximum sum of the weights of three nodes that are connected, we can use the concept of brute force. 

First, we will create a list of all possible combinations of three nodes. Then, for each combination, we will check if the three nodes are connected. If they are connected, we will calculate the sum of their weights and update the maximum sum if necessary.

Here is the Python code to solve this problem:

```python
import itertools

weights = [[0, 3], [1, 8], [2, 6], [3, 1], [4, 7], [5, 3], [6, 3], [7, 4], [8, 4], [9, 1], [10, 4], [11, 8], [12, 8], [13, 3], [14, 5], [15, 1]]
edges = [(0, 11), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 13), (0, 8), (1, 12), (1, 9), (1, 15), (1, 13), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 2), (1, 11), (2, 11), (2, 3), (2, 10), (2, 9), (2, 8), (2, 12), (2, 7), (3, 7), (3, 10), (3, 8), (3, 9), (3, 13), (4, 10), (4, 14), (4, 7), (5, 6), (5, 15), (5, 8), (5, 7), (5, 12), (6, 9), (6, 15), (6, 11), (6, 8), (7, 14), (7, 11), (8, 10), (8, 14), (8, 9), (9, 11), (9, 10), (10, 12), (10, 11), (10, 13), (11, 12), (13, 15), (14, 15)]

# Create a dictionary to store the weights of each node
weights_dict = {}
for weight in weights:
    weights_dict[weight[0]] = weight[1]

# Create a set to store the edges
edges_set = set(edges)

max_sum = 0

# Generate all possible combinations of three nodes
combinations = list(itertools.combinations(range(16), 3))

# Check each combination
for combination in combinations:
    node1, node2, node3 = combination
    
    # Check if the three nodes are connected
    if (node1, node2) in edges_set and (node2, node3) in edges_set and (node1, node3) in edges_set:
        # Calculate the sum of their weights
        current_sum = weights_dict[node1] + weights_dict[node2] + weights_dict[node3]
        
        # Update the maximum sum if necessary
        if current_sum > max_sum:
            max_sum = current_sum

print("The maximum sum of the weights of three nodes is:", max_sum)
```

When we run this code, the output will be:

```
The maximum sum of the weights of three nodes is: 24
```

So, the maximum sum of the weights of three connected nodes is 24.

Q: The nodes are numbered from 0 to 13, weights of nodes are: [0, 1] [1, 4] [2, 10] [3, 9] [4, 2] [5, 8] [6, 2] [7, 8] [8, 3] [9, 3] [10, 4] [11, 4] [12, 3] [13, 1], and the edges are: (0, 11) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 4) (1, 12) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 2) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 9) (2, 12) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 9) (4, 7) (5, 11) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 10) (6, 11) (6, 7) (6, 13) (6, 8) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 9) (8, 11) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 13) (9, 13) (9, 12) (9, 10) (10, 11) (10, 12) (11, 13) (11, 12) (12, 13). What is the maximum sum of the weights of three nodes?
A: To find the maximum sum of the weights of three nodes that are connected, we can use a brute force approach. We will iterate through all possible combinations of three nodes and calculate the sum of their weights if they are connected.

Here is the Python code to solve this problem:

```python
import itertools

# Define the weights of nodes
weights = {
    0: 1, 1: 4, 2: 10, 3: 9, 4: 2, 5: 8, 6: 2, 7: 8, 8: 3, 9: 3, 10: 4, 11: 4, 12: 3, 13: 1
}

# Define the edges of the graph
edges = [
    (0, 11), (0, 3), (0, 7), (0, 9), (0, 5), (0, 4), (1, 12), (1, 9), (1, 10), (1, 8), (1, 13),
    (1, 2), (2, 3), (2, 11), (2, 9), (2, 12), (2, 7), (2, 5), (2, 4), (3, 5), (3, 13), (3, 12),
    (3, 11), (3, 10), (3, 8), (3, 9), (3, 6), (4, 6), (4, 13), (4, 9), (4, 7), (5, 11), (5, 7),
    (5, 8), (5, 10), (6, 11), (6, 7), (6, 13), (6, 8), (7, 11), (7, 13), (7, 9), (8, 11), (8, 10),
    (8, 12), (8, 13), (9, 13), (9, 12), (9, 10), (10, 11), (10, 12), (11, 13), (11, 12), (12, 13)
]

# Initialize the maximum sum
max_sum = 0

# Iterate through all combinations of three nodes
for combination in itertools.combinations(range(14), 3):
    node1, node2, node3 = combination

    # Check if the three nodes are connected
    if (node1, node2) in edges and (node2, node3) in edges and (node1, node3) in edges:
        # Calculate the sum of their weights
        current_sum = weights[node1] + weights[node2] + weights[node3]

        # Update the maximum sum if necessary
        if current_sum > max_sum:
            max_sum = current_sum

# Output the maximum sum
print("Maximum sum of weights of three connected nodes:", max_sum)
```

Running this code will give the output:

```
Maximum sum of weights of three connected nodes: 27
```

Therefore, the maximum sum of the weights of three connected nodes in the given graph is 27.
