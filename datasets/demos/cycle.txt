Q: The nodes are numbered from 0 to 8, and the edges are: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (3, 8) (3, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 8). Is there a cycle in this graph?
A: To determine whether there is a cycle in the given undirected graph, we can use the Depth First Search (DFS) algorithm.

Here is the step-by-step process to check for a cycle using DFS:

1. Initialize a visited array to keep track of visited nodes and a parent array to keep track of the parent of each node.
2. Start DFS from each unvisited node in the graph.
3. For each node, mark it as visited and recursively visit all its adjacent nodes.
4. If an adjacent node is already visited and not the parent of the current node, then there is a cycle in the graph.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until all nodes are visited or a cycle is found.

Let's apply this algorithm to the given graph:

The nodes are numbered from 0 to 8, and the edges are: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (3, 8) (3, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 8).

Starting from node 0:
- Node 0 is visited.
- Node 5 is visited.
- Node 7 is visited.
- Node 8 is visited.
- Node 2 is visited.
- Node 4 is visited.
- Node 1 is visited.
- Node 8 is already visited and not the parent of node 1, so there is a cycle.

Therefore, there is a cycle in the given graph.

Output: Yes
### Yes


Q: The nodes are numbered from 0 to 8, and the edges are: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (3, 8) (3, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 8). Is there a cycle in this graph?
A: To determine if there is a cycle in the given undirected graph, we can use the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm. Here's how we can do it:

1. Create an adjacency list to represent the graph. In this case, the adjacency list will look like this:
   0: [5]
   1: [4, 8, 2]
   2: [4, 6, 7, 3, 8, 5]
   3: [8, 4]
   4: [1, 2, 3]
   5: [0, 2, 7, 8]
   6: [2]
   7: [2, 5, 8]
   8: [1, 2, 3, 5, 7]

2. Initialize a visited array to keep track of visited nodes. Mark all nodes as not visited initially.

3. For each node in the graph, if it is not visited, call the DFS function.

4. In the DFS function, mark the current node as visited and recursively visit all its adjacent nodes.

5. While visiting the adjacent nodes, if a visited node is encountered (other than the parent node), then there is a cycle in the graph.

Applying these steps to the given graph:

- Starting from node 0:
  - Visit node 5: Mark it as visited.
    - Visit node 7: Mark it as visited.
      - Visit node 2: Mark it as visited.
        - Visit node 4: Mark it as visited.
          - Visit node 3: Mark it as visited.
            - Visit node 8: Mark it as visited.
              - Visit node 1: Mark it as visited.
                - Visit node 2: Node 2 is already visited. Hence, there is a cycle in the graph.
              - Backtrack to node 8 and complete the DFS.
            - Backtrack to node 3 and complete the DFS.
          - Backtrack to node 4 and complete the DFS.
        - Backtrack to node 2 and complete the DFS.
      - Backtrack to node 7 and complete the DFS.
    - Backtrack to node 5 and complete the DFS.
  - Backtrack to node 0 and complete the DFS.

Since we encountered a cycle during the DFS process, the output is "Yes".
### Yes


Q: The nodes are numbered from 0 to 10, and the edges are: (0, 8) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 9) (1, 8) (2, 10) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 5) (4, 10) (4, 7) (5, 10) (5, 6) (5, 9) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 10) (7, 9) (8, 10) (9, 10). Is there a cycle in this graph?
A: To determine whether there is a cycle in the given graph, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. 

Here is the step-by-step process:

1. Initialize a visited array to keep track of visited nodes and set all nodes as unvisited.
2. Start from any node and perform a DFS traversal.
3. For each node, check if it has any unvisited neighbors. If it does, recursively visit the neighbor and mark it as visited.
4. If during the DFS traversal, we encounter a visited node that is not the parent of the current node, then there is a cycle in the graph.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 for all unvisited nodes until all nodes have been visited or a cycle is found.

Let's apply this algorithm to the given graph:

The nodes are numbered from 0 to 10, and the edges are: 
(0, 8) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 9) (1, 8) (2, 10) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 5) (4, 10) (4, 7) (5, 10) (5, 6) (5, 9) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 10) (7, 9) (8, 10) (9, 10).

Starting from node 0, we perform a DFS traversal:

0 -> 8 -> 1 -> 3 -> 7 -> 2 -> 10 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 9

During the traversal, we encounter node 8 again, which is already visited and not the parent of the current node. This indicates the presence of a cycle in the graph.

Therefore, the answer is Yes, there is a cycle in the given graph.
### Yes


Q: The nodes are numbered from 0 to 4, and the edges are: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4). Is there a cycle in this graph?
A: To determine whether there is a cycle in the given graph, we can use the Depth First Search (DFS) algorithm.

Starting from any node, we perform a DFS traversal and keep track of the visited nodes. During the traversal, if we encounter a visited node that is not the parent of the current node, then there is a cycle in the graph.

Let's perform the DFS traversal on the given graph:

Starting from node 0:
- Visit node 0 and mark it as visited.
- Visit node 1 and mark it as visited. (0, 1)
- Visit node 2 and mark it as visited. (1, 2)
- Visit node 4 and mark it as visited. (1, 4)
- Since all the neighbors of node 1 are visited, backtrack to node 1.
- Since all the neighbors of node 0 are visited, backtrack to node 0.

Starting from node 3:
- Visit node 3 and mark it as visited. (0, 3)
- Since all the neighbors of node 0 are visited, backtrack to node 0.

Since we have visited all the nodes and there is no visited node that is not the parent of the current node, we can conclude that there is no cycle in the given graph.

Therefore, the output is No.
