Determine whether or not there is a cycle in an undirected graph. Begin with '###' to give your final conclusion.
In an undirected graph, (i,j) means that node i and node j are connected with an undirected edge.
Given a graph, you need to output Yes or No, indicating whether there is a cycle in the graph.

Below are examples:

Q: The nodes are numbered from 0 to 5, and the edges are: (3,4) (3,5) (1,0) (2,5) (2,0). Is there a cycle in this graph?
A: Nodes 3, 4, and 5 are connected to each other, but there's no way to form a cycle with these connections without revisiting an edge.
Nodes 1 and 0 are connected, but this pair doesn't connect to any other nodes, so they cannot form a cycle.
Nodes 2, 5, and 0 are connected, but again, there's no cycle formation possible without revisiting an edge.
Thus, with no cycle formation possible without reusing edges, there is no cycle in this graph. ### No. 


Q: The nodes are numbered from 0 to 5, and the edges are: (3,5) (1,0) (3,0) (3,4) (4,1) (2,3). Is there a cycle in this graph?
A: Starting from node 3, we can go to nodes 5, 0, 4, and 2.
From node 0, we can reach nodes 3 and 1.
From node 4, we can reach nodes 3 and 1.
From node 1, we can reach nodes 0 and 4.
By looking at these connections, we can see there is indeed a cycle. For example, starting from node 3, we can go to node 0 (via edge 3-0), then to node 1 (via edge 1-0), then to node 4 (via edge 4-1), and back to node 3 (via edge 3-4). This forms a cycle [3-0-1-4-3] without revisiting any edge.
Thus, there is a cycle in this graph. ### Yes.


Q: The nodes are numbered from 0 to 7, and the edges are: (7,1) (5,7) (0,2) (3,7) (2,4) (5,6) (2,6). Is there a cycle in this graph?
A: Starting from node 7, we can reach nodes 1, 5, and 3. None of these nodes lead to a cycle back to 7 without reusing an edge.
Starting from node 0, we can only reach node 2. There's no cycle involving node 0.
Nodes 2, 4, and 6 are connected, but there's no way to form a cycle with these nodes without reusing an edge. For example, if you start at node 2, you can reach node 4 (via 2-4) and node 6 (via 2-6), but you cannot return to node 2 without reusing one of these edges.
Thus, with no cycle formation possible without reusing edges, there is no cycle in this graph. ### No. 


Q: The nodes are numbered from 0 to 5, and the edges are: (0,1) (2,6) (2,0) (5,3) (1,4) (4,7) (3,7) (6,4). Is there a cycle in this graph?
A: Starting from node 0, we can go to nodes 1 and 2.
From node 1, we can reach nodes 0 and 4.
Node 2 connects to nodes 6 and 0.
Node 3 connects to nodes 5 and 7.
Node 4 connects to nodes 1, 7, and 6.
Node 6 connects to nodes 2 and 4.
Node 7 connects to nodes 4 and 3.
Analyzing these connections, we can find a cycle: Starting from node 0, we can go to node 1 (via edge 0-1), then to node 4 (via edge 1-4), then to node 6 (via edge 6-4), then to node 2 (via edge 2-6) and back to node 0 (via edge 2-0).
This forms a cycle [0-1-4-6-2-0] without revisiting any edge.
So, there is a cycle in this graph. ### Yes.
