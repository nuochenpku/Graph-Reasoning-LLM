Q: The nodes are numbered from 0 to 37, and the edges are: (0, 11) (0, 30) (0, 22) (0, 13) (0, 21) (1, 33) (1, 19) (1, 10) (1, 9) (1, 27) (1, 18) (1, 34) (2, 5) (2, 15) (2, 36) (2, 8) (3, 10) (4, 27) (5, 12) (5, 17) (5, 31) (6, 7) (6, 26) (6, 12) (7, 31) (7, 36) (7, 32) (7, 29) (8, 16) (8, 10) (9, 23) (9, 25) (10, 18) (10, 15) (11, 12) (11, 18) (11, 14) (11, 19) (11, 31) (11, 20) (12, 24) (13, 19) (13, 36) (14, 35) (14, 22) (16, 33) (17, 24) (17, 35) (18, 26) (19, 20) (20, 30) (20, 23) (21, 35) (21, 29) (21, 31) (23, 28) (25, 26) (26, 36) (28, 34) (30, 34) (33, 37) (35, 37). Is there a path between node 30 and node 11? Output Yes or No. Begin with '###' to give your final conclusion.

A: To determine if there is a path between node 30 and node 11 in the given undirected graph, we can use a graph traversal algorithm such as Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS).

Let's use the DFS algorithm to check if there is a path between these two nodes:

1. Start at node 30.
2. Mark node 30 as visited.
3. Check if node 30 is the target node (node 11). If yes, output "Yes" and end.
4. If node 30 is not the target node, recursively visit all unvisited neighbors of node 30.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until all reachable nodes are visited or the target node is found.

Let's go through the steps:

1. Start at node 30.
2. Mark node 30 as visited.
3. Node 30 is not the target node.
4. Node 30 has two unvisited neighbors: node 0 and node 20.
   - Visit node 0.
     - Mark node 0 as visited.
     - Node 0 is not the target node.
     - Node 0 has five unvisited neighbors: node 11, node 30 (already visited), node 22, node 13, and node 21.
       - Visit node 11.
         - Mark node 11 as visited.
         - Node 11 is the target node (node 11).
         - Output "Yes" and end.

### Yes


Q: The nodes are numbered from 0 to 11, and the edges are: (0, 6) (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 9) (3, 10) (3, 8) (3, 7) (4, 8) (4, 11) (5, 11) (5, 10) (9, 11). Is there a path between node 0 and node 10? Output Yes or No. Begin with '###' to give your final conclusion.
A: To determine if there is a path between node 0 and node 10 in the given undirected graph, we can use a graph traversal algorithm such as Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS).

Let's use the DFS algorithm to check for a path between node 0 and node 10:

1. Start at node 0.
2. Mark node 0 as visited.
3. Check if node 0 is the target node (node 10). If yes, output "Yes" and terminate.
4. If node 0 is not the target node, recursively visit all unvisited neighboring nodes of node 0.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for each unvisited neighboring node of node 0.
6. If all nodes have been visited and the target node (node 10) has not been found, output "No".

Using DFS, we find that there is a path between node 0 and node 10. Therefore, the output is:

### Yes

Q: The nodes are numbered from 0 to 3, and the edges are: (1, 3) (2, 3). Is there a path between node 0 and node 2? Output Yes or No. Begin with '###' to give your final conclusion.
A: To determine if there is a path between node 0 and node 2 in the given undirected graph, we can perform a depth-first search (DFS) starting from node 0 and check if we can reach node 2.

Here is the step-by-step process:

1. Initialize an empty stack and a visited array to keep track of visited nodes.
2. Push node 0 onto the stack and mark it as visited.
3. While the stack is not empty, do the following:
   - Pop a node from the stack.
   - If the popped node is node 2, then there is a path between node 0 and node 2. Output "Yes" and terminate.
   - Otherwise, for each neighbor of the popped node that has not been visited, push it onto the stack and mark it as visited.
4. If the stack becomes empty and node 2 has not been visited, then there is no path between node 0 and node 2. Output "No".

Let's apply this algorithm to the given graph:

1. Start with node 0.
2. Visit node 0 and push it onto the stack.
3. Pop node 0 from the stack.
4. Node 0 has no unvisited neighbors.
5. The stack is empty and node 2 has not been visited.
6. Output "No".

### No


Q: The nodes are numbered from 0 to 10, and the edges are: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 4) (0, 1) (1, 10) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 6) (4, 8) (4, 6) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 7) (7, 10) (7, 9) (8, 10) (8, 9). Is there a path between node 4 and node 7? Output Yes or No. Begin with '###' to give your final conclusion.
A: To determine if there is a path between node 4 and node 7, we can use a graph traversal algorithm such as depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS).

Using DFS:

1. Initialize an empty stack and a visited array to keep track of visited nodes.
2. Push node 4 onto the stack and mark it as visited.
3. While the stack is not empty:
   a. Pop a node from the stack.
   b. If the popped node is node 7, then there is a path between node 4 and node 7. Output "Yes" and exit.
   c. Otherwise, for each adjacent node of the popped node that has not been visited, push it onto the stack and mark it as visited.
4. If the stack becomes empty without finding node 7, then there is no path between node 4 and node 7. Output "No".

### Yes
