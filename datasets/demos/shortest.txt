Find the shortest path between two nodes in an undirected graph.
In an undirected graph, (i,j,k) means that node i and node j are connected with an undirected edge with weight k.
Given a graph and a pair of nodes, you need to output the shortest path between the two nodes.

Blow are several examples:

Q: The nodes are numbered from 0 to 4, and the edges are: (0,4,1) (0,1,3) (1,2,6) (3,4,3). Give the weight of the shortest path from node 3 to node 4.
A: When looking at the graph with nodes 0 to 4 and the specified edges, our focus is on finding the shortest path from node 3 to node 4. Here, we have a direct edge (3,4) with a weight of <<3>>.
It's important to note that there's no alternative route involving other nodes that could offer a shorter path, as the connections don't facilitate another pathway between these two nodes.
Therefore, the direct route between nodes 3 and 4, with its weight of 3, stands as the shortest path. ### 3.


Q: The nodes are numbered from 0 to 5, and the edges are: (0,1,5) (1,5,2) (2,3,3) (2,5,7) (3,4,9). Give the weight of the shortest path from node 0 to node 1.
A: Examining the provided edges, we notice there's a direct connection between these two nodes, represented by the edge (0,1,5). This edge has a weight of <<5>>, indicating the distance or cost of travel between them.
We should also consider if there are any alternative routes that might offer a shorter path. However, the other edges in the graph connect different nodes and don't provide a more direct or shorter route between node 0 and node 1.
Therefore, the shortest path weight from node 0 to node 1 in your graph is 5. ### 5.


Q: In an undirected graph, the nodes are numbered from 0 to 6, and the edges are: (0,1,1) (1,2,2) (0,2,4) (0,4,2) (2,6,2) (4,6,4) (4,3,5) (6,5,3) (3,5,4). Give the weight of the shortest path from node 0 to node 5.
A: All the paths from node 0 to node 5 are:
0,2,6,5 with a total weight of <<4 + 2 + 3 = 9>>,
0,1,2,6,5 with a total weight of <<1 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 8>>,
0,4,6,5 with a total weight of <<2 + 4 + 3 = 9>>,
0,4,3,5 with a total weight of <<2 + 5 + 4 = 11>>.
The weight of path 0,1,2,6,5 is the smallest, so the shortest path from node 0 to node 5 is [0,1,2,6,5] with a total weight of 8. #### 8.


Q: In an undirected graph, the nodes are numbered from 0 to 4, and the edges are: (0,3,2) (0,4,1) (0,2,1) (4,1,2) (2,1,1) (3,2,4) (2,4,1) (3,4,2). Give the weight of the shortest path from node 3 to node 1.
A: All the paths from node 3 to node 1 are:
3,2,1 with a total weight of <<4 + 1 = 5>>,
3,2,4,1 with a total weight of <<4 + 1 + 2 = 7>>,
3,4,1 with a total weight of <<2 + 2 = 4>>,
3,4,2,1 with a total weight of <<2 + 1 + 1 = 4>>,
3,0,4,1 with a total weight of <<2 + 1 + 2 = 5>>,
3,0,2,1 with a total weight of <<2 + 1 + 1 = 4>>,
3,4,2,4,1 with a total weight of <<2 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 6>>.
The weight of path 3,4,1 is the smallest, so the shortest path from node 3 to node 1 is [3,4,1] with a total weight of 4. ### 4.
