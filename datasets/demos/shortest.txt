Q: The nodes are numbered from 0 to 1, and the edges are: (0,1,3). Give the shortest path from node 1 to node 0.
To find the shortest path between two nodes in an undirected graph, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here's how you can apply it to the given graph:

1. Initialize a distance array to store the shortest distance from the source node to all other nodes. Set the distance of the source node to 0 and the distances of all other nodes to infinity.

2. Create a priority queue (min-heap) to store the nodes and their corresponding distances. Insert the source node with distance 0 into the priority queue.

3. While the priority queue is not empty, do the following:
   - Extract the node with the minimum distance from the priority queue.
   - For each neighbor of the extracted node, calculate the distance from the source node to the neighbor through the extracted node. If this distance is smaller than the current distance of the neighbor, update its distance and insert it into the priority queue.

4. After the algorithm finishes, the distance array will contain the shortest distance from the source node to all other nodes.

To find the shortest path from node 1 to node 0, you can backtrack from node 0 to node 1 using the distance array. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. Apply Dijkstra's algorithm to the given graph starting from node 1.

2. After the algorithm finishes, the distance array will contain the shortest distance from node 1 to all other nodes. In this case, the distance array will be [3, 0].

3. Start from node 0 and check its neighbors. Since node 1 is the only neighbor of node 0, we can conclude that the shortest path from node 1 to node 0 is the direct edge between them.

Therefore, the shortest path from node 1 to node 0 is the edge (1, 0) with weight 3.

Q: The nodes are numbered from 0 to 15, and the edges are: (0,1,7) (0,4,8) (0,3,10) (0,13,3) (1,13,10) (1,7,2) (1,4,4) (1,14,4) (1,12,9) (1,9,3) (2,14,9) (2,10,1) (2,12,2) (2,5,7) (2,11,3) (2,7,5) (2,9,6) (2,6,6) (3,10,8) (3,13,1) (3,9,9) (3,8,6) (3,11,7) (3,4,3) (3,14,5) (4,5,8) (4,10,9) (4,13,2) (4,14,4) (4,7,8) (4,9,8) (5,6,7) (5,11,7) (5,13,7) (5,10,6) (5,7,4) (6,8,4) (6,13,2) (6,12,5) (6,11,6) (7,9,6) (8,11,9) (8,14,6) (8,15,1) (9,10,10) (9,13,1) (9,12,3) (10,14,5) (11,12,4) (11,14,8) (12,13,10) (14,15,2). Give the weight of the shortest path from node 10 to node 11.
A: To find the shortest path between two nodes in an undirected graph, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here's how you can use it to find the weight of the shortest path from node 10 to node 11:

1. Create a list to store the distances from the starting node (node 10) to all other nodes in the graph. Initialize all distances to infinity, except for the distance to the starting node itself, which is 0.

2. Create a priority queue to store the nodes to be visited, with the starting node as the first element.

3. While the priority queue is not empty, do the following steps:

   a. Extract the node with the minimum distance from the priority queue.

   b. For each neighbor of the extracted node, calculate the new distance as the sum of the extracted node's distance and the weight of the edge connecting them.

   c. If the new distance is smaller than the current distance to the neighbor, update the distance and add the neighbor to the priority queue.

4. After the algorithm finishes, the distance to the target node (node 11) will be the weight of the shortest path from node 10 to node 11.

Using this algorithm on the given graph, the weight of the shortest path from node 10 to node 11 is 4.

Q: The nodes are numbered from 0 to 16, and the edges are: (0,3,1) (0,13,9) (0,5,8) (0,16,1) (0,2,1) (0,10,2) (0,4,7) (0,14,8) (0,1,8) (0,9,9) (0,8,2) (1,5,1) (1,8,3) (1,4,4) (1,11,1) (1,10,8) (1,3,7) (1,13,8) (1,16,3) (1,15,1) (1,2,5) (2,9,8) (2,10,6) (2,14,4) (2,3,9) (2,8,8) (2,11,7) (2,5,3) (2,13,3) (2,4,7) (2,12,4) (3,7,9) (3,5,3) (3,15,1) (3,10,1) (3,4,6) (3,16,5) (4,16,7) (4,11,1) (4,9,7) (4,14,9) (5,13,4) (5,16,7) (5,10,2) (5,12,6) (5,6,6) (6,12,8) (6,10,6) (6,11,9) (6,7,6) (6,9,3) (6,8,9) (7,16,1) (7,12,6) (7,15,1) (7,13,4) (7,11,3) (7,8,6) (7,10,10) (8,14,9) (8,13,6) (8,11,2) (9,14,2) (9,15,8) (9,12,7) (9,11,3) (10,15,10) (10,16,8) (10,11,2) (10,12,5) (10,14,7) (11,16,2) (11,14,5) (11,15,1) (12,15,9) (12,16,1) (12,14,6) (12,13,6) (13,16,3) (13,15,3) (13,14,5) (14,15,7). Give the weight of the shortest path from node 10 to node 6.
A: To find the shortest path between two nodes in an undirected graph, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here's how you can apply it to find the shortest path from node 10 to node 6:

1. Create a distance array to store the shortest distance from node 10 to all other nodes in the graph. Initialize all distances to infinity except for the distance from node 10 to itself, which should be 0.

2. Create a visited array to keep track of the nodes that have been visited. Initialize all nodes as unvisited.

3. Set the current node to node 10.

4. While there are unvisited nodes:
   - Mark the current node as visited.
   - Update the distances of the neighboring nodes of the current node. If the distance from the current node to a neighboring node is smaller than the current distance stored in the distance array, update the distance array with the new smaller distance.
   - Select the unvisited node with the smallest distance as the new current node.

5. Once all nodes have been visited or if the current node is the destination node (node 6), stop the algorithm.

6. The weight of the shortest path from node 10 to node 6 can be found in the distance array at index 6.

Using this algorithm on the given graph, the weight of the shortest path from node 10 to node 6 is 6.


Q: The nodes are numbered from 0 to 1, and the edges are: (0,1,5). Give the weight of the shortest path from node 0 to node 1.
A: To find the shortest path between two nodes in an undirected graph, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here's how you can apply it to the given graph:

1. Create a priority queue to store the nodes to be visited, with their respective distances from the source node. Initialize all distances to infinity except for the source node, which is set to 0. Set the source node as the current node.

2. While the priority queue is not empty:
   a. Remove the node with the minimum distance from the priority queue. Let's call this node "current".
   b. If the current node is the target node, we have found the shortest path. Return the distance to the target node.
   c. Otherwise, for each neighbor of the current node:
      - Calculate the distance from the source node to the neighbor, by adding the weight of the edge between the current node and the neighbor to the distance of the current node.
      - If this calculated distance is smaller than the previously recorded distance for the neighbor, update the distance and add the neighbor to the priority queue.

3. If we reach this point, it means that there is no path from the source node to the target node. Return -1 to indicate that there is no shortest path.

Applying this algorithm to the given graph, we have:
- Set the source node as node 0, and the target node as node 1.
- Initialize the distance of node 0 as 0, and the distance of node 1 as infinity.
- Start with the current node as node 0.
- The only neighbor of node 0 is node 1, with a weight of 5.
- Calculate the distance from node 0 to node 1 as 0 + 5 = 5.
- Update the distance of node 1 to 5.
- Since node 1 is the target node, we have found the shortest path with a distance of 5.

Therefore, the weight of the shortest path from node 0 to node 1 is 5.
