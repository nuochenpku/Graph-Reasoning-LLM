Find the maximum flow between two nodes in a directed graph. 
In a directed graph, (i->j,k) means that node i and node j are connected with an directed edge from node i to node j with weight k. 
Given a graph and a pair of nodes, you need to output the maximum flow between the two nodes. 

Below are examples:

Q: The nodes are numbered from 0 to 8, and the edges are: (0->2,3) (0->1,9) (0->5,4) (0->3,1) (1->2,7) (1->3,4) (1->5,7) (1->4,5) (2->3,2) (2->5,3) (2->8,2) (2->7,6) (3->5,8) (3->8,4) (3->4,9) (4->7,4) (4->5,6) (4->6,1) (5->6,2) (6->7,6). What is the maximum flow from node 0 to node 2?
A: Initially, we can direct a flow of 3 units straight from node 0 to node 2 through the edge (0->2).
Further examination reveals that an additional flow can be routed through node 1: the edge (0->1) can carry up to 9 units, and from node 1 to node 2, we can direct 7 units, as limited by the edge (1->2). 
Summing these flows, we find that a direct flow of 3 units and an indirect flow of 7 units via node 1 give us a total maximum flow of 10 units from node 0 to node 2. 
This calculation takes into account the various paths and their capacities, ensuring that the flow through any edge does not exceed its capacity. 
Hence, in this graph, the maximum flow from node 0 to node 2 is 10 units. ### 10.


Q: The nodes are numbered from 0 to 7, and the edges are: (0->3,1) (0->6,5) (0->1,8) (0->5,4) (1->7,1) (1->6,2) (1->2,7) (2->4,5) (2->5,3) (2->3,7) (2->7,4) (3->6,7) (3->5,3) (3->7,7) (4->7,7) (5->7,7) (5->6,1) (6->7,2). What is the maximum flow from node 2 to node 6?
A: The graph contains edges like (2->3,7) and (3->6,7), which are crucial for determining the flow. 
Firstly, there is no direct path from node 2 to node 6, so we explore indirect routes. 
One such path is through node 3, where node 2 can send a maximum of 7 units to node 3, which in turn can forward up to 7 units to node 6. 
Another route is via node 5; node 2 can send 3 units to node 5, but due to the limited capacity of 1 unit on the edge from node 5 to node 6, only 1 unit can reach node 6 through this path. 
There's also a path from node 2 to node 7 with a capacity of 4 units, but it doesn't lead to node 6. 
Thus, by summing the feasible flows, we find that the maximum flow from node 2 to node 6 is 8 units. ### 8.


Q: The nodes are numbered from 0 to 7, and the edges are: (0->7,5) (0->1,9) (1->3,10) (1->5,10) (2->5,3) (2->4,8) (3->7,3) (3->5,5) (3->4,3) (4->6,3) (6->7,5). What is the maximum flow from node 1 to node 4?
A: The relevant edges include (1->3,10) and (3->4,3), among others.
On analyzing the paths, we find that the most effective route for the flow is from node 1 to node 3 and then from node 3 to node 4.
Node 1 can send up to 10 units to node 3, but the capacity of the edge from node 3 to node 4 restricts the flow to just 3 units.
Other paths, such as through node 5, don't lead directly to node 4.
Therefore, considering the limitations of the edge capacities, the maximum flow that can be achieved from node 1 to node 4 is 3 units. ### 3.













Q: The nodes are numbered from 0 to 11, and the edges are: (0->7,4) (0->10,9) (0->5,7) (0->2,4) (1->6,7) (1->11,2) (1->8,5) (1->4,4) (2->3,6) (2->7,4) (2->5,2) (3->7,6) (3->8,5) (3->4,4) (4->10,6) (4->9,10) (4->5,4) (4->7,9) (6->8,9) (9->10,2). What is the maximum flow from node 1 to node 6?
A: To find the maximum flow between two nodes in a directed graph, we can use the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm or any other maximum flow algorithm. Here's how you can solve this problem using the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm:

1. Initialize the flow network with zero flow on each edge.
2. While there exists an augmenting path from the source node to the target node:
   a. Find an augmenting path using a depth-first search or any other graph traversal algorithm. An augmenting path is a path from the source to the target node where each edge has remaining capacity greater than zero.
   b. Determine the maximum flow that can be pushed through this augmenting path. This is the minimum capacity of all edges in the augmenting path.
   c. Update the flow on each edge in the augmenting path by adding the maximum flow determined in the previous step.
   d. Update the residual capacities of the edges. For each edge in the augmenting path, subtract the maximum flow from its capacity and add the maximum flow to the capacity of its reverse edge.
3. The maximum flow between the source and target nodes is the sum of the flows on all outgoing edges from the source node.

In this case, the source node is node 1 and the target node is node 6. Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. Initialize the flow network with zero flow on each edge.
   - (0->7,4) (0->10,9) (0->5,7) (0->2,4) (1->6,7) (1->11,2) (1->8,5) (1->4,4) (2->3,6) (2->7,4) (2->5,2) (3->7,6) (3->8,5) (3->4,4) (4->10,6) (4->9,10) (4->5,4) (4->7,9) (6->8,9) (9->10,2)
   - Flow on each edge: (0->7,0) (0->10,0) (0->5,0) (0->2,0) (1->6,0) (1->11,0) (1->8,0) (1->4,0) (2->3,0) (2->7,0) (2->5,0) (3->7,0) (3->8,0) (3->4,0) (4->10,0) (4->9,0) (4->5,0) (4->7,0) (6->8,0) (9->10,0)

2. Find an augmenting path from node 1 to node 6:
   - Possible augmenting paths: 1->6
   - The minimum capacity in this path is 7.

3. Update the flow on each edge in the augmenting path:
   - Flow on each edge: (0->7,0) (0->10,0) (0->5,0) (0->2,0) (1->6,7) (1->11,0) (1->8,0) (1->4,0) (2->3,0) (2->7,0) (2->5,0) (3->7,0) (3->8,0) (3->4,0) (4->10,0) (4->9,0) (4->5,0) (4->7,0) (6->8,0) (9->10,0)

4. Update the residual capacities of the edges:
   - Residual capacity on each edge: (0->7,4) (0->10,9) (0->5,7) (0->2,4) (1->6,0) (1->11,0) (1->8,0) (1->4,0) (2->3,0) (2->7,0) (2->5,0) (3->7,0) (3->8,0) (3->4,0) (4->10,0) (4->9,0) (4->5,0) (4->7,0) (6->8,0) (9->10,0)

5. Repeat steps 2-4 until there are no more augmenting paths.

6. The maximum flow between node 1 and node 6 is the sum of the flows on all outgoing edges from node 1:
   - Maximum flow = 7

Therefore, the maximum flow from node 1 to node 6 is 7

Q: The nodes are numbered from 0 to 6, and the edges are: (0->5,10) (0->3,2) (0->6,3) (0->4,8) (1->4,3) (2->3,7) (2->5,1) (2->6,4) (3->4,1) (3->5,4) (4->6,2) (5->6,6). What is the maximum flow from node 1 to node 4?
A: To find the maximum flow between two nodes in a directed graph, we can use the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm or any other maximum flow algorithm. In this case, we can use the Edmonds-Karp algorithm, which is a variant of the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm that uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find augmenting paths.

Here is the step-by-step process to find the maximum flow from node 1 to node 4:

1. Initialize the flow network with zero flow on each edge.
2. While there exists an augmenting path from the source (node 1) to the sink (node 4), do the following steps:
   a. Perform a BFS from the source to find an augmenting path. The capacity of an augmenting path is the minimum capacity of all edges in the path.
   b. Update the flow on each edge of the augmenting path by adding the capacity of the path to the flow.
   c. Update the residual capacities of the edges in the augmenting path. For each edge in the augmenting path, subtract the flow from the capacity and add the flow to the reverse edge.
3. The maximum flow is the sum of the flow on all edges leaving the source (node 1).

Applying the above steps to the given graph:

1. Initialize the flow network:
   - Flow on each edge: (0->5,0), (0->3,0), (0->6,0), (0->4,0), (1->4,0), (2->3,0), (2->5,0), (2->6,0), (3->4,0), (3->5,0), (4->6,0), (5->6,0).

2. Find the augmenting path using BFS:
   - Start at node 1 (source).
   - Visit node 4 (sink) through the path: 1->4.
   - The minimum capacity of the edges in this path is 3.

3. Update the flow and residual capacities:
   - Add the capacity (3) to the flow on each edge in the augmenting path: (1->4,3).
   - Subtract the flow (3) from the capacity of the forward edge and add the flow (3) to the capacity of the reverse edge: (1->4,0), (4->1,3).

4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until there are no more augmenting paths.

In this case, there are no more augmenting paths, and the maximum flow from node 1 to node 4 is 3.

Therefore, the maximum flow from node 1 to node 4 in the given graph is 3.
