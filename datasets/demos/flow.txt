Find the maximum flow between two nodes in a directed graph. 
In a directed graph, (i->j,k) means that node i and node j are connected with an directed edge from node i to node j with weight k. 
Given a graph and a pair of nodes, you need to output the maximum flow between the two nodes. 

Below are examples:

Q: The nodes are numbered from 0 to 8, and the edges are: (0->2,3) (0->1,9) (0->5,4) (0->3,1) (1->2,7) (1->3,4) (1->5,7) (1->4,5) (2->3,2) (2->5,3) (2->8,2) (2->7,6) (3->5,8) (3->8,4) (3->4,9) (4->7,4) (4->5,6) (4->6,1) (5->6,2) (6->7,6). What is the maximum flow from node 0 to node 2?
A: Initially, we can direct a flow of 3 units straight from node 0 to node 2 through the edge (0->2).
Further examination reveals that an additional flow can be routed through node 1: the edge (0->1) can carry up to 9 units, and from node 1 to node 2, we can direct 7 units, as limited by the edge (1->2). 
Summing these flows, we find that a direct flow of 3 units and an indirect flow of 7 units via node 1 give us a total maximum flow of 10 units from node 0 to node 2. 
This calculation takes into account the various paths and their capacities, ensuring that the flow through any edge does not exceed its capacity. 
Hence, in this graph, the maximum flow from node 0 to node 2 is 10 units. ### 10.


Q: The nodes are numbered from 0 to 7, and the edges are: (0->3,1) (0->6,5) (0->1,8) (0->5,4) (1->7,1) (1->6,2) (1->2,7) (2->4,5) (2->5,3) (2->3,7) (2->7,4) (3->6,7) (3->5,3) (3->7,7) (4->7,7) (5->7,7) (5->6,1) (6->7,2). What is the maximum flow from node 2 to node 6?
A: The graph contains edges like (2->3,7) and (3->6,7), which are crucial for determining the flow. 
Firstly, there is no direct path from node 2 to node 6, so we explore indirect routes. 
One such path is through node 3, where node 2 can send a maximum of 7 units to node 3, which in turn can forward up to 7 units to node 6. 
Another route is via node 5; node 2 can send 3 units to node 5, but due to the limited capacity of 1 unit on the edge from node 5 to node 6, only 1 unit can reach node 6 through this path. 
There's also a path from node 2 to node 7 with a capacity of 4 units, but it doesn't lead to node 6. 
Thus, by summing the feasible flows, we find that the maximum flow from node 2 to node 6 is 8 units. ### 8.


Q: The nodes are numbered from 0 to 7, and the edges are: (0->7,5) (0->1,9) (1->3,10) (1->5,10) (2->5,3) (2->4,8) (3->7,3) (3->5,5) (3->4,3) (4->6,3) (6->7,5). What is the maximum flow from node 1 to node 4?
A: The relevant edges include (1->3,10) and (3->4,3), among others.
On analyzing the paths, we find that the most effective route for the flow is from node 1 to node 3 and then from node 3 to node 4.
Node 1 can send up to 10 units to node 3, but the capacity of the edge from node 3 to node 4 restricts the flow to just 3 units.
Other paths, such as through node 5, don't lead directly to node 4.
Therefore, considering the limitations of the edge capacities, the maximum flow that can be achieved from node 1 to node 4 is 3 units. ### 3.
