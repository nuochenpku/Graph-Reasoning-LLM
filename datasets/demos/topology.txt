Find one of the topology sorting paths of the given graph. 
In a directed graph, (i->j) means that node i and node j are connected with a directed edge from node i to node j.
Given a graph, you need to output one of the topology sorting paths of the graph. 

Below are several examples:


Q: The nodes are numbered from 0 to 4, and the edges are: (0->3) (0->4) (0->1) (0->2) (1->4) (1->3) (2->4) (2->3) (3->4). Give one topology sorting path of this graph.
A: To find a topological sorting path for the directed graph with nodes 0 to 4 and edges like (0->3), (0->4), and so on, we can apply a method where we choose nodes with no incoming edges, one by one. 
Initially, node 0 is selected as it doesn't have any incoming edges. 
Next, nodes 1 and 2 become candidates after removing node 0 and its edges; 
let's pick node 1. Following this, node 2 is the next choice. 
After removing node 2, node 3 becomes our next pick. 
Finally, node 4, being the only remaining node, is chosen. 
Consequently, a valid topological sorting path for this graph is in the order of [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. ### [0, 1, 2, 3, 4].


Q: The nodes are numbered from 0 to 3, and the edges are: (0->3) (0->2) (1->3) (2->3). Give one topology sorting path of this graph.
A: we can adopt a strategy where nodes are sequentially chosen based on the absence of incoming edges. 
Initially, nodes 0 and 1 stand out as they have no edges leading into them. 
Starting with node 0, it logically precedes nodes 2 and 3 due to its outgoing edges. 
Following node 0, we select node 2, which is connected directly from node 0. Node 1 is the next choice, as it doesnâ€™t depend on node 2 and leads into node 3. 
Finally, node 3, being the endpoint of edges from nodes 0, 1, and 2, is placed last in the sequence. 
This methodical selection process results in a topological sorting path of [0, 2, 1, 3] for the graph, adhering to the directional flow of its edges. ### [0, 2, 1, 3].


Q: The nodes are numbered from 0 to 3, and the edges are: (0->2) (0->3) (1->3) (2->3). Give one topology sorting path of this graph.
A: we can apply a systematic approach where we sequentially choose nodes that have no incoming edges.
Starting with the available nodes, we observe that nodes 0 and 1 do not have any incoming edges and can be considered as starting points. 
Let's begin with node 0, followed by node 1, as neither has dependencies on the other nodes.
After placing node 0 and node 1, node 2 is the next logical choice. Node 2 only has an incoming edge from node 0, which has already been placed in the sequence.
Finally, node 3, which has incoming edges from all the previously placed nodes (0, 1, and 2), can be placed last in the sequence.
Thus, a valid topological sorting path for this graph is: [0, 1, 2, 3]. ### [0, 1, 2, 3].


Q: The nodes are numbered from 0 to 4, and the edges are: (0->4) (0->2) (0->3) (0->1) (1->4) (1->3) (1->2) (2->3). Give one topology sorting path of this graph.
A: We apply a method where nodes are selected one by one, prioritizing those with no incoming edges from the remaining unselected nodes. 
Initially, node 0 is chosen because it has no incoming edges. 
Following this, node 1 is the next logical selection, as its only incoming edge is from node 0, already placed in the sequence. 
Afterward, node 2 is picked, considering its incoming edges are from nodes 0 and 1, both of which have been previously selected. 
Subsequently, node 3, receiving edges from nodes 0, 1, and 2, fits well next in the order. 
Finally, node 4, with incoming edges from nodes 0 and 1, concludes the sequence without any conflict in the topological arrangement. 
Thus, a feasible topological sorting path for this graph is determined as [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. ### [0, 1, 2, 3, 4].
