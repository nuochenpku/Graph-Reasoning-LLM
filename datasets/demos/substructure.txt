Determine if a smaller graph is present as an exact match within a larger graph. 
In a directed graph, (i->j) means that node i and node j are connected with a directed edge from node i to node j. 
Given a graph G and a subgraph G', you need to output Yes or No, indicating whether subgraph G' is present within the directed graph G.

Below are examples:

Q: The nodes of graph G are numbered from 0 to 7, and the edges are: (0->4) (0->5) (0->2) (0->3) (0->1) (0->7) (1->6) (1->5) (1->4) (1->7) (1->3) (2->7) (2->5) (2->6) (2->3) (3->4) (3->6) (3->7) (3->5) (4->7) (4->6) (4->5) (5->6) (5->7) (6->7). The nodes of subgraph G' are numbered from a to e, and the edges are: (a->b) (b->c) (b->e) (b->d) (c->e) (c->d). Is subgraph G' present within graph G as a direct substructure?
A: To determine if subgraph G' is present within graph G, let's briefly analyze both graphs:
Subgraph G' has the following edges: (a->b), (b->c), (b->e), (b->d), (c->e), (c->d). The key node here is 'b', which has outgoing edges to three different nodes: 'c', 'e', and 'd'. Additionally, 'c' has outgoing edges to both 'e' and 'd'.
Now let's find a node in graph G with similar outgoing edges:
Node 0 has outgoing edges to many nodes but is not a match since no single node has outgoing edges to three other nodes that also interconnect as required.
Node 1 has outgoing edges to '6', '5', '4', and '7' but none of these nodes have the required interconnections to match 'c', 'e', and 'd'.
Node 2 has outgoing edges to '7', '5', '6', and '3', but again, no suitable interconnections.
Node 3 has outgoing edges to '4', '6', '7', and '5'. This resembles 'b' in G', but there must be interconnections between the nodes it points to, matching (c->e), (c->d).
Node 4 has outgoing edges to '7', '6', and '5'. If node 4 is 'b', then nodes '7', '6', and '5' could be 'c', 'e', and 'd'. Since '7', '6', and '5' are all interconnected, node 4 and its connected nodes match the structure of G'.
Thus, the sequence (4->7), (7->6), (7->5), (6->7), (5->7) in G corresponds to the sequence (b->c), (c->e), (c->d), (e->d), (d->e) in G', which means subgraph G' is present as a direct substructure in graph G. ### Yes.


Q: The nodes of graph G are numbered from 0 to 9, and the edges are: (0->6) (0->2) (1->2) (1->7) (1->3) (3->4) (3->8) (3->9) (4->9). The nodes of subgraph G' are numbered from a to d, and the edges are: (a->d) (a->c) (a->b) (b->d) (b->c) (c->d). Is subgraph G' present within graph G as a direct substructure?
A:To find if subgraph G' is present in graph G, we look for a node with out-degree of 3 (like 'a' in G'), and among those outgoing connections, we need two nodes with an out-degree of at least 2 (like 'b' and 'c' in G'), which are also connected to each other and to the third node (like 'd' in G').
Examining graph G:
Node 0 has out-degree 2, not enough to match 'a'.
Node 1 has out-degree 3, so it could be 'a', with nodes 2, 7, and 3 potentially being 'b', 'c', and 'd'.
Node 3 has out-degree 3, so it could be 'a', with nodes 4, 8, and 9 potentially being 'b', 'c', and 'd'.
Now we must check the connections between the potential 'b', 'c', and 'd' nodes:
For node 1 as 'a', nodes 2, 7, and 3 do not have the required mutual connections.
For node 3 as 'a', nodes 4, 8, and 9 do not have the required mutual connections either, since there's no edge from 4 to 8 or 9 to 8.
None of the nodes satisfy the conditions of subgraph G' fully. ### No.


Q: The nodes of graph G are numbered from 0 to 8, and the edges are: (0->5) (0->4) (2->3) (2->7) (3->5) (3->4) (3->8) (5->6) (5->7). The nodes of subgraph G' are numbered from a to d, and the edges are: (a->b) (a->d) (a->c) (b->c) (b->d) (c->d). Is subgraph G' present within graph G as a direct substructure?
A: To find if subgraph G' is present in graph G, we need to identify a node in G that has directed edges to three other nodes, just like 'a' in G'. Each of these three nodes must connect to each other to form a complete directed subgraph.
Looking at graph G:
Node 0 connects to nodes 4 and 5, but not three nodes, eliminating it as a candidate for 'a'.
Node 2 connects to nodes 3 and 7. Even though node 3 has three outgoing edges, node 2 does not have an outgoing edge to a third node that node 3 connects to, so the connection pattern does not match G'.
Node 3 connects to nodes 4, 5, and 8, with node 5 having outgoing edges to nodes 6 and 7. This resembles the pattern in G', where 'a' connects to 'b', 'c', and 'd', and 'b' connects to 'c' and 'd'.
Checking the connections of node 3's targets:
Node 3 to 4 (potential 'b')
Node 3 to 5 (potential 'c')
Node 3 to 8 (potential 'd')
Node 4 does not connect to 5 or 8, so it cannot be 'b'.
Node 5 connects to 6 and 7 but not to 8, so it cannot be 'c'.
Node 8 receives no connections from 4 or 5, so it cannot be 'd'.
No node in G has the outgoing connectivity that matches the pattern from 'a' in G', and thus, there is no exact match for subgraph G' within graph G. ### No.


Q: The nodes of graph G are numbered from 0 to 7, and the edges are: (0->3) (0->5) (0->7) (0->1) (0->6) (0->2) (0->4) (1->5) (1->2) (1->4) (1->6) (2->5) (2->7) (2->6) (2->3) (3->4) (3->7) (4->7) (4->5) (4->6) (5->7) (5->6) (6->7). The nodes of subgraph G' are numbered from a to c, and the edges are: (a->b) (b->c). Is subgraph G' present within graph G as a direct substructure?
A: Subgraph G' is a simple directed chain with the edges (a->b) and (b->c). We need to find such a sequence in graph G, where one node directs to another, and that node in turn directs to a third.
Given the simplicity of G', we only need to find a node in G that has an out-degree of at least 1, and the node it points to also has an out-degree of at least 1.
Looking at graph G, every node except node 7 has an out-degree of at least 1, and since the edges are directed and there are no isolated nodes, there is bound to be a node that points to another node which also points to a third node.
For instance, taking node 0:
Node 0->3 (node 0 could represent 'a' and node 3 could represent 'b')
Node 3->4 (node 3, already representing 'b', has an outgoing edge to node 4, which could represent 'c')
Hence, the sequence 0->3->4 in graph G is a direct match for the structure a->b->c in subgraph G'.
Therefore, G' is present within graph G as a direct substructure. ### Yes.
