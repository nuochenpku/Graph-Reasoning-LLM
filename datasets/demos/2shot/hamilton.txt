Determine whether or not there is a Hamiltonian path in an undirected graph.
In an undirected graph, (i,j) means that node i and node j are connected with an undirected edge.
Given a graph, you need to output 'Yes' or 'No', indicating whether there is a Hamiltonian path in the graph. 

Below are several examples:


Q: The nodes are numbered from 0 to 5, and the edges are: (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (4, 5). Is there a Hamiltonian path in this graph?
A: To determine if a Hamiltonian path exists in an undirected graph, we need to check if there's a path that visits each node exactly once. 
Starting at Node 0, we can go to Node 1 (which connects to Nodes 2, 3, 4).
From Node 1, moving to Node 4 seems a strategic choice because Node 4 only connects back to Node 1 and to Node 5. After reaching Node 4, we must go to Node 5.
From Node 5, we can go to Node 3, as Node 3 connects to Nodes 0 and 1 (which we've visited) and to Node 5.
Finally, from Node 3, we can go to Node 2.
So, one possible Hamiltonian path is: [0,1,4,5,3,2].
Therefore, there is a Hamiltonian path in this graph. ### Yes, [0,1,4,5,3,2].


Q: The nodes are numbered from 0 to 5, and the edges are: (0,2) (0,1) (4,5) (4,3) (4,2) (5,3) (1,4) (2,5). Is there a Hamiltonian path in this graph?
A: To determine if a Hamiltonian path exists in an undirected graph, we need to check if there's a path that visits each node exactly once. 
We can start at node 0. As node 0 is connected with ndoe 2, and node 2 is not visited, we can then visit node 2.
As node 2 is connected with ndoe 5, and node 5 is not visited, we can then visit node 5.
As node 5 is connected with ndoe 3, and node 3 is not visited, we can then visit node 3.
As node 3 is connected with ndoe 4, and node 4 is not visited, we can then visit node 4.
As node 4 is connected with ndoe 1, and node 1 is not visited, we can then visit node 1.
So, one possible Hamiltonian path is: [0,2,5,3,4,1].
Therefore, there is a Hamiltonian path in this graph. ### Yes, [0,2,5,3,4,1].
