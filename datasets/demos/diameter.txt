Q: The nodes are numbered from 0 to 6, and the edges are: (0,2,4) (1,3,1) (1,4,5) (2,3,10) (2,6,4) (3,5,10) (4,5,10) (5,6,6). What is the diameter of this graph?
A: To find the diameter of an undirected graph, we need to find the longest shortest path between any two nodes in the graph.

In this case, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest paths from a source node to all other nodes in the graph. We can repeat this process for each node in the graph and find the maximum shortest path length.

Here is the step-by-step process to find the diameter of the given graph:

1. Initialize the graph with the given edges and their weights.
2. For each node in the graph, perform Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest paths from that node to all other nodes.
3. Keep track of the maximum shortest path length found during the process.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for all nodes in the graph.
5. The maximum shortest path length found is the diameter of the graph.

Let's calculate the diameter of the given graph:

1. Initialize the graph with the given edges and their weights:
   - Node 0 is connected to Node 2 with weight 4.
   - Node 1 is connected to Node 3 with weight 1.
   - Node 1 is connected to Node 4 with weight 5.
   - Node 2 is connected to Node 3 with weight 10.
   - Node 2 is connected to Node 6 with weight 4.
   - Node 3 is connected to Node 5 with weight 10.
   - Node 4 is connected to Node 5 with weight 10.
   - Node 5 is connected to Node 6 with weight 6.

2. Perform Dijkstra's algorithm for each node in the graph:
   - Starting from Node 0:
     - Shortest path from Node 0 to Node 2: 4
     - Shortest path from Node 0 to Node 3: 14
     - Shortest path from Node 0 to Node 4: 9
     - Shortest path from Node 0 to Node 5: 19
     - Shortest path from Node 0 to Node 6: 8
   - Starting from Node 1:
     - Shortest path from Node 1 to Node 3: 1
     - Shortest path from Node 1 to Node 4: 5
     - Shortest path from Node 1 to Node 5: 15
     - Shortest path from Node 1 to Node 6: 12
   - Starting from Node 2:
     - Shortest path from Node 2 to Node 3: 10
     - Shortest path from Node 2 to Node 4: 14
     - Shortest path from Node 2 to Node 5: 20
     - Shortest path from Node 2 to Node 6: 4
   - Starting from Node 3:
     - Shortest path from Node 3 to Node 5: 10
     - Shortest path from Node 3 to Node 6: 14
   - Starting from Node 4:
     - Shortest path from Node 4 to Node 5: 10
     - Shortest path from Node 4 to Node 6: 16
   - Starting from Node 5:
     - Shortest path from Node 5 to Node 6: 6

3. Maximum shortest path length found: 20

Therefore, the diameter of the given graph is 20.

Q: The nodes are numbered from 0 to 4, and the edges are: (0,4,2) (1,2,8) (1,4,3) (3,4,7). What is the diameter of this graph?
A: To find the diameter of a graph, we need to find the longest shortest path between any two nodes in the graph. 

In this case, we have the following edges:
(0,4,2)
(1,2,8)
(1,4,3)
(3,4,7)

To find the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm or Floyd-Warshall algorithm. However, since the graph is small and simple, we can manually calculate the shortest paths.

The shortest paths between each pair of nodes are as follows:

Shortest path between 0 and 1: 0 -> 4 -> 1 (distance = 2 + 3 = 5)
Shortest path between 0 and 2: 0 -> 4 -> 1 -> 2 (distance = 2 + 3 + 8 = 13)
Shortest path between 0 and 3: 0 -> 4 -> 3 (distance = 2 + 7 = 9)
Shortest path between 0 and 4: 0 -> 4 (distance = 2)

Shortest path between 1 and 2: 1 -> 4 -> 0 -> 2 (distance = 3 + 2 + 8 = 13)
Shortest path between 1 and 3: 1 -> 4 -> 3 (distance = 3 + 7 = 10)
Shortest path between 1 and 4: 1 -> 4 (distance = 3)

Shortest path between 2 and 3: 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3 (distance = 8 + 3 + 7 = 18)
Shortest path between 2 and 4: 2 -> 1 -> 4 (distance = 8 + 3 = 11)

Shortest path between 3 and 4: 3 -> 4 (distance = 7)

The longest shortest path in this graph is between nodes 2 and 3, with a distance of 18. Therefore, the diameter of this graph is 18.

Q: The nodes are numbered from 0 to 6, and the edges are: (0,3,9) (0,4,4) (0,2,10) (1,6,2) (1,4,6) (1,5,9) (2,6,4) (3,5,5) (5,6,7). What is the diameter of this graph?
A: To find the diameter of an undirected graph, we need to find the longest path between any two nodes in the graph.

In this case, the given graph has the following edges:
(0,3,9) (0,4,4) (0,2,10) (1,6,2) (1,4,6) (1,5,9) (2,6,4) (3,5,5) (5,6,7)

To find the diameter, we need to calculate the shortest path between all pairs of nodes using a suitable algorithm like Dijkstra's algorithm or Floyd-Warshall algorithm.

Here is the shortest path matrix for the given graph:

       | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
   --------------------------------
   0 | 0 | 11| 10| 9 | 4 |14 | 8 |
   1 |11| 0 |16 | ∞ | 6 | 9 | 2 |
   2 |10|16 | 0 | ∞ | ∞ | ∞ | 4 |
   3 | 9 | ∞ | ∞ | 0 | ∞ | 5 | ∞ |
   4 | 4 | 6 | ∞ | ∞ | 0 | ∞ | ∞ |
   5 |14 | 9 | ∞ | 5 | ∞ | 0 | 7 |
   6 | 8 | 2 | 4 | ∞ | ∞ | 7 | 0 |

From the matrix, we can see that the longest shortest path between any two nodes is 16, which is the distance between nodes 1 and 2.

Therefore, the diameter of the given graph is 16.

- Shortest path from 0 to 4: 0 -> 3 -> 4, with a total weight of 8 + 6 = 14.

Now, let's calculate the shortest paths from node 1 to all other nodes:
- Shortest path from 1 to 0: 1 -> 3 -> 0, with a total weight of 10 + 8 = 18.
- Shortest path from 1 to 2: 1 -> 3 -> 2, with a total weight of 10 + 2 = 12.
- Shortest path from 1 to 3: 1 -> 3, with a total weight of 10.
- Shortest path from 1 to 4: 1 -> 4, with a total weight of 8.

Now, let's calculate the shortest paths from node 2 to all other nodes:
- Shortest path from 2 to 0: 2 -> 3 -> 0, with a total weight of 2 + 8 = 10.
- Shortest path from 2 to 1: 2 -> 3 -> 1, with a total weight of 2 + 10 = 12.
- Shortest path from 2 to 3: 2 -> 3, with a total weight of 2.
- Shortest path from 2 to 4: 2 -> 3 -> 4, with a total weight of 2 + 6 = 8.

Now, let's calculate the shortest paths from node 3 to all other nodes:
- Shortest path from 3 to 0: 3 -> 0, with a total weight of 8.
- Shortest path from 3 to 1: 3 -> 1, with a total weight of 10.
- Shortest path from 3 to 2: 3 -> 2, with a total weight of 2.
- Shortest path from 3 to 4: 3 -> 4, with a total weight of 6.

Finally, let's calculate the shortest paths from node 4 to all other nodes:
- Shortest path from 4 to 0: 4 -> 3 -> 0, with a total weight of 6 + 8 = 14.
- Shortest path from 4 to 1: 4 -> 1, with a total weight of 8.
- Shortest path from 4 to 2: 4 -> 3 -> 2, with a total weight of 6 + 2 = 8.
- Shortest path from 4 to 3: 4 -> 3, with a total weight of 6.

Now, we can determine the diameter of the graph by finding the longest shortest path among all pairs of nodes. In this case, the longest shortest path is from node 0 to node 1, with a total weight of 18.

Therefore, the diameter of this graph is 18.
