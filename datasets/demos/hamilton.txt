Determine whether or not there is a Hamiltonian path in an undirected graph.
In an undirected graph, (i,j) means that node i and node j are connected with an undirected edge.
Given a graph, you need to output 'Yes' or 'No', indicating whether there is a Hamiltonian path in the graph. 

Below are several examples:


Q: The nodes are numbered from 0 to 5, and the edges are: (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (4, 5). Is there a Hamiltonian path in this graph?
A: To determine if a Hamiltonian path exists in an undirected graph, we need to check if there's a path that visits each node exactly once. 
Starting at Node 0, we can go to Node 1 (which connects to Nodes 2, 3, 4).
From Node 1, moving to Node 4 seems a strategic choice because Node 4 only connects back to Node 1 and to Node 5. After reaching Node 4, we must go to Node 5.
From Node 5, we can go to Node 3, as Node 3 connects to Nodes 0 and 1 (which we've visited) and to Node 5.
Finally, from Node 3, we can go to Node 2.
So, one possible Hamiltonian path is: [0,1,4,5,3,2].
Therefore, there is a Hamiltonian path in this graph. ### Yes, [0,1,4,5,3,2].


Q: The nodes are numbered from 0 to 5, and the edges are: (0,2) (0,1) (4,5) (4,3) (4,2) (5,3) (1,4) (2,5). Is there a Hamiltonian path in this graph?
A: To determine if a Hamiltonian path exists in an undirected graph, we need to check if there's a path that visits each node exactly once. 
We can start at node 0. As node 0 is connected with ndoe 2, and node 2 is not visited, we can then visit node 2.
As node 2 is connected with ndoe 5, and node 5 is not visited, we can then visit node 5.
As node 5 is connected with ndoe 3, and node 3 is not visited, we can then visit node 3.
As node 3 is connected with ndoe 4, and node 4 is not visited, we can then visit node 4.
As node 4 is connected with ndoe 1, and node 1 is not visited, we can then visit node 1.
So, one possible Hamiltonian path is: [0,2,5,3,4,1].
Therefore, there is a Hamiltonian path in this graph. ### Yes, [0,2,5,3,4,1]. 


Q: The nodes are numbered from 0 to 7, and the edges are: (2,3) (5,1) (6,0) (5,3) (7,1) (3,7) (0,5) (6,5) (2,6) (3,4) (1,4) (2,0) (6,4) (1,6). Is there a Hamiltonian path in this graph?
A: To determine if a Hamiltonian path exists in an undirected graph, we need to check if there's a path that visits each node exactly once. 
As node 4 is connected with node 6, and node 6 is not visited, we can then visit node 6.
As node 6 is connected with node 2, and node 2 is not visited, we can then visit node 2.
As node 2 is connected with node 0, and node 0 is not visited, we can then visit node 0.
As node 0 is connected with node 5, and node 5 is not visited, we can then visit node 5.
As node 5 is connected with node 1, and node 1 is not visited, we can then visit node 1.
As node 1 is connected with node 7, and node 7 is not visited, we can then visit node 7.
So, one possible Hamiltonian path is: [3,4,6,2,0,5,1,7].
Therefore, there is a Hamiltonian path in this graph. ### Yes, [3,4,6,2,0,5,1,7].


Q: The nodes are numbered from 0 to 5, and the edges are: (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 4). Is there a Hamiltonian path in this graph?
A: In analyzing the graph with nodes from 0 to 5 and the given edges, we observe that node 0 is isolated, having no connections to any other nodes.
Since a Hamiltonian path requires visiting each node exactly once, the presence of an isolated node like node 0 makes it impossible to form such a path.
The other nodes (1 to 5) are interconnected, suggesting that a Hamiltonian path could exist if not for the isolated node 0.
Therefore, the conclusion is that there is no Hamiltonian path in this graph due to the disconnected nature of node 0. ### No.
