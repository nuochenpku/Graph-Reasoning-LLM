            " There is no shortage of possible groups of three interconnected nodes, but we can use a simple heuristic to guide our search for the maximum sum. That heuristic is based on the fact that a node with a higher weight has more options to connect to other nodes, and thus has a higher chance of being part of a group of three interconnected nodes. Therefore, we can start with the nodes with the highest weights, and then look for the ones with the lowest weights that are still connected to them. \nFor example, we can start with node 0, which has a weight of 1. Then we can look for its neighbors, which are nodes 4 and 10, both of which have weights of 5. Next, we can look for the neighbors of nodes 4 and 10, which are nodes 9, 8, 5, 18, and 11, all of which have weights of 2 or 3. Then we can look for the neighbors of these nodes, which are nodes 19, 16, 15, 14, 7, 6, 12, and 17, all of which have weights of 4 or 5. At this point, we have found a large number of nodes, but we can use a simple algorithm like sorting the nodes by their weights or using a priority queue to search for the ones with the highest weights. \nOne possible way to find the maximum sum of the weights of three interconnected nodes is to use a priority queue, which is a way of organizing the nodes by their finishing times in a race. We can start with node 0, which has a finishing time of 0, and then add its neighbors, which are nodes 4 and 10, both of which have finishing times of 5. Then we can add the neighbors of nodes 4 and 10, which are nodes 9, 8, 5, 18, and 11, all of which have finishing times of 2 or 3. Then we can add the neighbors of these nodes, which are nodes 19, 16, 15, 14, 7, 6, 12, and 17, all of which have finishing times of 4 or 5.

They can be implemented recursively or iteratively, and can be optimized by using some heuristics such as ordering the nodes by their weights, pruning branches that are likely to fail, or using bitmasks to represent the visited nodes.

            " The graph consists of nodes with the following weights: Node 0 at 4, Node 1 at 2, Node 2 at 8, Node 3 at 3, Node 4 at 10, Node 5 at 6, Node 6 at 3, Node 7 at 3, Node 8 at 6, Node 9 at 8, Node 10 at 3, Node 11 at 3, Node 12 at 4, Node 13 at 3, Node 14 at 9, Node 15 at 1, Node 16 at 7, Node 17 at 4, Node 18 at 9, Node 19 at 7, Node 20 at 8, Node 21 at 3, and Node 22 at 5. \nLooking at the edges, we can see that there are many connections between these nodes. However, we can also see that some nodes are more connected than others, and some edges are more important than others. For example, the edge (0, 5) is not as important as the edge (1, 16), and the edge (8, 10) is not as important as the edge (14, 22). \nWe can use a technique where we select nodes that have a high degree (number of edges) or a high importance, and then remove them and their edges from the graph. This way, we can focus on the nodes that are left, and see if they can form a new maximum sum of the weights of three interconnected nodes. \nFor example, we can start with node 0, which has a high degree of 4. Then, we can remove node 0 and its edges from the graph, and look for the next node that has a high degree. We can see that node 1 has a high degree of 2, so we can select it and remove it and its edges from the graph. Then, we can look for the next node that has a high degree, and we can see that node 2 has a high degree of 8, so we can select it and remove it and its edges from the graph. Continuing this process, we can select nodes 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, and 21, and remove them and their edges from the graph. \nFinally, we can see that node 22 has a high degree of 5, and it is the only node left in the graph. Therefore, we can select it and remove it and its edges from the graph. This way, we can focus on the nodes that are left, and see if they can form a new maximum sum of the weights of three interconnected nodes. \nWe can see that node 22 has six neighbors: node 14, node 18, node 19, node 21, node 0, and node 1. Among these neighbors, node 0 and node 1 are the only ones that are not connected to each other. This means that if we select node 22, we can choose either node 0 or node 1 as the other endpoint of the sum. \nLet's say we choose node 0 as the other endpoint of the sum. Then, we can see that node 0 has five neighbors: node 5, node 16, node 20, node 3, and node 1. Among these neighbors, node 5 and node 16 are the only ones that are not connected to each other. This means that if we select node 0, we can choose either node 5 or node 16 as the other endpoint of the sum. \nLet's say we choose node 5 as the other endpoint of the sum. Then, we can see that node 5 has three neighbors: node 0, node 21, and node 3. Among these neighbors, node 0 and node 21 are the only ones that are not connected to each other. This means that if we select node 5, we can choose either node 0 or node 21 as the other endpoint of the sum. \nLet's say we choose node 21 as the other endpoint of the sum. Then, we can see that node 21 has three neighbors: node 5, node 6, and node 22. Among these neighbors, node 5 and node 22 are the only ones that are not connected to each other. This means that if"
