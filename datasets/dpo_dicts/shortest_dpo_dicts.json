The neighbors of 43 are 23, 27, 48, and 55, with edge weights 3, 7, 9, and 12 respectively.

Q: The nodes are numbered from 0 to 84, and the edges are: (0,68,6) (0,14,5) (0,47,3) (0,21,7) (0,78,5) (0,23,6) (1,23,5) (2,47,10) (2,67,9) (2,53,10) (2,25,7) (2,73,8) (3,29,7) (3,22,3) (3,20,4) (4,30,8) (4,77,3) (4,83,1) (5,37,9) (5,70,4) (5,50,4) (5,34,7) (5,42,1) (6,53,8) (6,35,7) (7,26,4) (7,53,8) (7,31,8) (8,35,4) (8,57,8) (9,17,1) (9,55,8) (9,24,3) (9,31,8) (9,62,7) (10,51,8) (10,78,8) (10,80,1) (11,17,6) (11,45,6) (11,69,2) (11,34,9) (12,74,8) (12,53,3) (13,59,1) (13,46,8) (13,39,2) (13,43,9) (14,29,5) (15,56,7) (15,78,3) (15,67,5) (16,28,1) (16,55,7) (16,26,6) (16,81,7) (17,29,7) (17,58,7) (17,69,1) (17,76,2) (18,34,6) (18,39,7) (18,26,1) (18,67,5) (18,83,10) (18,27,7) (19,42,2) (19,69,4) (19,48,10) (19,61,8) (19,82,3) (19,41,1) (20,35,4) (20,37,3) (21,55,10) (21,79,8) (21,27,5) (22,28,2) (22,65,3) (22,31,1) (22,82,1) (22,45,7) (23,39,6) (23,58,7) (24,55,4) (24,30,4) (24,62,9) (24,36,9) (24,40,4) (24,64,6) (25,44,7) (25,73,8) (25,54,1) (25,34,3) (25,66,1) (25,77,10) (26,36,8) (27,80,1) (27,31,9) (27,69,10) (27,43,1) (28,34,1) (28,58,8) (29,31,6) (29,45,1) (30,81,9) (30,77,5) (30,79,3) (31,39,10) (31,80,2) (32,33,2) (32,77,6) (32,55,4) (32,63,5) (32,64,4) (33,66,5) (34,41,10) (34,71,7) (34,61,2) (35,39,7) (35,70,6) (35,80,9) (36,45,2) (37,58,4) (37,73,5) (37,65,4) (37,78,10) (38,60,8) (38,55,4) (39,40,1) (39,54,2) (40,84,2) (41,58,8) (41,68,7) (42,69,3) (43,83,7) (43,62,1) (43,59,7) (43,64,10) (44,58,8) (44,76,7) (44,48,8) (45,74,1) (45,80,4) (46,66,10) (46,54,1) (47,63,4) (47,77,5) (48,79,5) (49,79,2) (49,61,3) (49,71,4) (50,68,7) (51,63,3) (51,54,6) (51,73,7) (52,83,3) (55,59,3) (55,68,10) (56,67,4) (56,80,7) (56,57,8) (57,70,8) (57,66,4) (59,80,4) (60,75,5) (61,76,10) (63,79,5) (63,67,4) (63,76,1) (64,75,3) (66,67,10) (68,77,4) (68,72,4) (70,77,9) (70,82,4) (71,75,9) (72,78,7) (75,79,5) (79,83,3) (83,84,2).
